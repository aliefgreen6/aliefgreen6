I'm Dr. Alice Liefgreen, a research fellow and lecturer at UCL in the division of Psychology and Language Sciences. I am currently working my way through the Data Science course with [Hyperion Dev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/). Here you'll find example data science projects and more!

## About Me
I am a Lecturer in the Language and Cognition Department at UCL. I hold an Honorary Research Fellowship at the Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law (Swansea), where I collaborate on a project focusing on the impact of deepfakes on trust in user-generated evidence in accountability processes for human rights violations. Prior to my current roles, I completed post-doctoral positions in the fields of risk communication, as well as trustworthy AI auditing. In 2022, I earned my Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from UCL on causal and evidential reasoning under uncertainty. I am looking to transition to a data science role, and just started the Data Science Bootcamp with HyperionDev!
